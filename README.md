# Stacks!

A little Tower Defense game I made during the lockdowns of 2020.
I never really finished it - life got in the way, but there's a few badly designed levels to play with.
If you get sufficiently bored and want to try it or mess around with the code, the unity version I last tested it on was **2021.3.24f1**
But it should work with any recent version after Unity does its importing and updating of scripts etc.

I tried to incorporate elements that I liked from various games like:
* tower's earning experience
* upgrading/selling/placing towers
* increasing wave strength
* tower targetting priorities
* earned perks and upgrades
* tower statistics
* achievements
* different tower types

Some of those work well, others not so much.
What I also wanted to do, which I'd not seen in a game before was stacking towers on top of each other, to make better use of the building space. Since I made this, I've seen games that use that now too. I'm not saying I was first, but it was an independent thought.

# Ignorable notes

There's more stuff there but it's mostly forgettable. One thing I remember having a lot of trouble with was the sniper's and rocket's targetting aiming for ghosts. It was discovered to be the object pooling, but my memory is fuzzy.

If I get time, I might upload an .exe or a web playable version to show it in action. It's not brilliant but I'm proud of it and it's simple enough to tinker with.

Maybe someday I'll even 'finish' it. There's a few little bugs I noticed when I play-tested it recently, like shot-effects appearing on new spawns - as their earlier incarnation, now dead spawn is disabled then reset I guess I neglected to reset any attached effects too. For these and all my other sins...

If you like this kind of thing, or you want to learn some (probably dubious or outdated) coding methods for this genre, then check this out.

# Future Plans
While doing my digital house keeping, I also discovered a version I'd started with buildable wall placements too. I'd like to get that working as it opens up a lot more strategy options. That would inevitably bring more stress to level design, but an idea I had about that was a simple league mechanic. The player is simply trying to better their last time, perhaps with reference to a league table - maybe even on the web for more notoriety. Using a few standard starting maps, coupled with perks for towers being able to be respecced anytime, and the buildable wall option  - all that would add a lot of strategic depth to the game. 
Who knows, maybe I'll even do that too.
